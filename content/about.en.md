# About the False Fire Documentary
The video False Fire: China's Tragic New Standard in State Deception which analyzes the 2001 Tiananmen Square "self-immolation" incident, won a Certificate of Honorable Mention at the 51st Columbus International Film & Video Festival. New Tang Dynasty TV, a non-profit privately owned Chinese TV station, produced the movie. The award ceremony was held in the Kansas Center, Columbus Arts College, Columbus, Ohio.

In the False Fire video program, NTD TV, who aims to provide truthful reporting and supports human rights, systematically analyzed suspicious places in the incident. The analysis exposed that the so-called self-immolation case was very likely directed by the Chinese government to frame Falun Gong and to fabricate excuses for the persecution of Falun Gong.
